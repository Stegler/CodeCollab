In order to make yourself appealing to other developers on CodeCollab, you'll want to put in a few basic pieces of information about yourself and your background. Be specific -- the more users know about your talents, the more they'll want to connect and collaborate!

On the **Edit** page, you'll be able to change your first and last name, and add your:

* Age -- we know it's just a number!
* Zip code -- important for others to find you!
* Bio -- tell other developers about yourself!
* Skills -- let people know what you're good at!
* GitHub and LinkedIn -- show off your work and resume!

Now that you've built out your profile, it's time to start browsing for other talented developers to find and collaborate with.
